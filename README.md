# Final Capstone Project

## Project Overview

The Final Capstone Project is a task management application implemented in Python. The main file of the project is `task_manager.py`, which relies on two text files: `user.txt` and `task.txt`. The project aims to refactor the code to enhance readability by incorporating global functions, utilizing lists functions, and improving string handling.
